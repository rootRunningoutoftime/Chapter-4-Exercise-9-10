# Chapter-4-Exercise-9-10
Write a program that plays the game,” Rock, Paper, Scissors.”

If you are not familiar with the game do your research (e.g., on the web using Google). Research is a common task for programmers, Use a switch-statement to solve this exercise. Also, the machine should give random answers (i.e., select the next rock, paper, or scissors randomly).Real randomness is too hard to provide just now, so just build a vector with a sequence of values to be used as “the next value.” If you build the vector into the program, it will always play the same, so maybe you should let the user enter some values. Try variations to make it less easy for the user to guess which move the machine will make next.

Find the largest number of squares for which I can calculate the exact number of grains (using an int) and which you can calculate the approximate number of grains (using a double)?
